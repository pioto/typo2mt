typo2mt - takes a typo database and converts it to a Movable Type import file

This script is for exporting a typo[1] blog database to the Movable Type import
format[2].

The standard usage is something like:

  typo2mt --dsn DBI:mysql:typo:localhost --user typo --password typ0_pasS > typo_export

This will export your blog to the typo_export file, which you can then
import[3] into Movable Type.

This script worked for me last year, but patches are welcome.
